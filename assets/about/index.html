					<p>ZAIRZA, a society, a cult for CETIANS who want to be ahead in the game. Sure we all have talent, in this club we put our talents through many obstacles and we conquer them. We walk out as winners who not only read books all these years but test the theories and sometimes make our own.</p>
	    			<p>The club is managed by its students and alumni. The society was founded in the year 2005 and got a officially recognition in the year 2007 as a technical society of CET.
	    			The society consists of three wings
	    			<blockquote><ol>
	    				<li>Robotics Wing</li>
	    		 		<li>Software Wing</li>
	    		 		<li>Automobile Wing</li>
	    			</ol></blockquote>
	    			</p>
	    		
	    			<p>Here at Zairza, we Design, we Create and we Innovate. Extensive research and development is carried out which equips the members with knowledge on various technological fields. Members are actively engaged in taking the society to greater height through their continuous efforts in the field of Engineering.</p> 

	    			<p>The legacy of Zairza flows down through each batch of CET which empowers us to stand ahead of our counterparts.</p>
